# Contributing

Contributors are always welcome! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## All code changes happen through pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. The ideal way to create a PR is:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from the main version branch (e.g. `v1.x`).
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue. It's that simple!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

[This is an example](https://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report that is just enough.

## Use a consistent coding style

Having a code well styled and organized is one of our top priorities. So we ask to follow the standards already in the code base, always based on [PSRs](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/).
